This is a simple react component for card draw from basic 52 playing card deck.
When loading the site the app shuffles the deck and by clicking a card, the next card from the pile will be shown.

# Setup
Very easy to setup and modify, no needed dependencies. Just copy 'src/App.js' and cards from the 'src/cards/' folder
